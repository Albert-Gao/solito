Solito 2 is a big step for the React Native + Next.js stack:

- **Next.js 13 support**
  - `Link` and `TextLink` support
  - Upgraded example monorepos
- **New `solito/image`:** Optimized cross-platform images
  - `next/image` on Web
  - `react-native-fast-image` on iOS & Android
  - Expo Go support
- Native stack `replace()` support

## Next.js 13 support

Solito 2 adds support for Next.js 13.

### Links

`TextLink` and `Link` now use Next.js' `legacyBehavior` prop under the hood. No user changes are required.

Similarly, Next.js' `useRouter` hook has been tree shaken on native to avoid runtime errors from Next.js 13 on iOS and Android.

### Upgraded example monorepos

All solito example monorepos have been upgraded to Next.js 13. The following changes were made:

- Increment Next.js version in `apps/next/package.json`
- Change `react-native-reanimated` SWC plugin in `apps/next/plugins`
- Upgrade `solito` to `2.0.0` in `packages/app/package.json`
- Upgrade `react` & `react-dom` in `apps/expo/package.json` to `18.2.0`
  - If you run `expo upgrade` in `apps/expo`, this version might get downgraded. If this happens, be sure to manually upgrade to at least `18.2.0`.

### Upgrade Guide

While Solito doesn't add any breaking changes to support Next.js 13, Next.js 13 itself does have [breaking changes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#breaking-changes). Please refer to [their upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading).

Since the minimum React/React DOM versions are now `18.2.0`, I recommend setting this version as a resolution in your monorepo's root `package.json` to avoid version mismatches:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0"
  }
}
```

## `solito/image`

Optimized images are one of the most-requested features for cross-platform development.

Solito 2 introduces [`SolitoImage`](/usage/image), which wraps `next/image` on Web and `react-native-fast-image` on iOS & Android.

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  src="/logo.png"
  height={100}
  width={200}
  alt="BeatGig logo"
  priority
/>
```

You can now use optimized, fast images across platforms with a single API.

A key goal of this component was to bring the `next/image` API to native. This meant porting the following features, among others:

- `sizes` property for optimized image sizes. Uses the `Dimensions` API on native.
- `priority` property
- Relative URL paths for images in the Next.js `public` folder
- Static files via imported via `import`
- `fill` property for absolute-filled styles
- Object fit/resize modes
- `style` property having same behavior, such as React Native's `transform` array.
- `loader` property for custom image loaders
- Global image configuration (via `SolitoImageProvider`)
  - Set a global `loader` instead of a `loaderFile`
  - Configure `deviceSizes`
  - Configure `imageSizes`

For more, see the [`SolitoImage` docs](/usage/image).

## Native Stack `replace()`

A common point of confusion for Solito users is the `router.replace()` function. On Web, it replaces the screen as expected. But on native, it always pushes a new screen, even when using a stack.

This limitation is due to the complexity of determining a user's navigation intentions in a composable way with URLs, especially when dealing with nested navigators.

To solve this feature request, Solito 2 introduces a new `nativeBehavior` option in the `router.replace()` function:

```ts
import { useRouter } from 'solito/router'

export function Home() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const openArtists = () => {
    replace('/artists', undefined, {
      experimental: {
        nativeBehavior: 'stack-replace',
        isNestedNavigator: true,
      },
    })
  }

  // ...
}
```

By passing `nativeBahvior: 'stack-replace'`, you tell Solito to re-write your navigation action with `StackActions.replace()`. The `isNestedNavigator` property is an important way to indicate to Solito that your stack is nested inside of another navigator, such as tabs. Chances are, this property will always be `true`.

You can also use this functionality on the `Link` and `TextLink` components when `replace` is set to `true`:

```tsx
<Link
  href="/artists"
  replace
  experimental={{
    nativeBehavior: 'stack-replace',
    isNestedNavigator: true,
  }}
/>
```

For now, this feature will live behind the `experimental` flag.

## Fonts

Since Solito's custom font loading recommendations are currently quite platform-specific, you should be able to take advantage of Next.js' new [`@next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) package without any changes on the native side.

## Open Questions

How will server components work with React Native (Web)? Frankly, I am not quite sure yet. For now, we'll have to see if the React Native team gives an indication of the existence of server components on the native side (whatever that might mean).

If you want to use RSC for data fetching on Web, you could presumably do this and pass down props to a client UI element. You'd just need an equivalent file on Native to fetch the same data using a regular data fetching solution, such as React Query, URQL, SWR, Apollo, etc.
