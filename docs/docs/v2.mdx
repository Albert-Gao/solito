Solito 2 brings the following new additions to cross-platform development:

- **Next.js 13 support**
  - `Link` and `TextLink` support
  - Upgraded example monorepos
- **New `solito/image`:** Optimized cross-platform images
  - `next/image` on Web
  - `react-native-fast-image` on iOS & Android
  - Expo Go support

## Next.js 13 support

Solito 2 adds support for Next.js 13.

### Links

`TextLink` and `Link` now use Next.js' `legacyBehavior` prop under the hood. No user changes are required.

Similarly, Next.js' `useRouter` hook has been tree shaken on native to avoid runtime errors from Next.js 13 on iOS and Android.

### Upgraded example monorepos

All solito example monorepos have been upgraded to Next.js 13. The following changes were made:

- Increment Next.js version in `apps/next/package.json`
- Change `react-native-reanimated` SWC plugin in `apps/next/plugins`
- Upgrade `solito` to `2.0.0` in `packages/app/package.json`
- Upgrade `react` & `react-dom` in `apps/expo/package.json` to `18.2.0`
  - If you run `expo upgrade` in `apps/expo`, this version might get downgraded. If this happens, be sure to manually upgrade to at least `18.2.0`.
