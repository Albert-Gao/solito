# Solito + NativeWind Example Monorepo üï¥

```sh
npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app -t with-tailwind
```

This example brings the power of Tailwind CSS to Solito, thanks to [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev)

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is a starter for an Expo + Next.js app using [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev) for its styling & [Solito](https://solito.dev) for navigation.

## üëì How NativeWind works with Solito

### Fast on every platform

NativeWind lets you use Tailwind while reducing runtime work on every platform.

### Web

NativeWind uses Next.js' `PostCSS` feature outputs CSS StyleSheets.

Which is to say: **on Web, you're using CSS.** Yes, that's right. We aren't parsing className strings into objects for React Native Web to read. We're forwarding down the CSS classnames to the DOM. That means you can get responsive styles & pseudo-selectors _with serverside rendering support_.

This is finally possible with the release of React Native Web 0.18.

As a result, using NativeWind with React Native doesn't have significant overhead compared to plain old Tailwind CSS.

If you're planning on making a website with Tailwind, you might be wondering, why not use Solito with NativeWind if I'm getting pure CSS outputs anyway?

### iOS and Android

While Web uses class names, React Native uses style objects.

Most approaches to using TailWind in React Native do something like this at runtime:

```ts
const styles = props.className
  .split(' ')
  .map((className) => makeStyle(className))
```

This means that every component ends up parsing strings to construct predictable style objects.

NativeWind takes a new, more performant approach. Thanks to its Babel plugin, this work is done at build time.

(The Babel plugin is an optional optimization, but you don't need to use it.)

NativeWind turns `className` strings into `StyleSheet.create` objects at build time, avoiding the [slow string parsing problem](https://twitter.com/terrysahaidak/status/1470735820915150850?s=20&t=w9VUPwiTFxBkRBHWTtDz1g) of libraries like `styled-components/native`.

Keep in mind that the Babel plugin will get used on iOS/Android only: on Web, we are simply forwarding the `className` prop to the DOM.

### Bringing it together

Components must be written using the `styled()` higher-order component:

```tsx
// packages/app/design/typography
import { Text } from 'react-native'
import { styled } from 'nativewind'

export const P = styled(Text, 'text-base text-black my-4')
```

Notice that you can set base styles using the second argument of `styled`.

The components can later be extended with the `className` prop, just like regular Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
<P className="dark:text-white">Solito + NativeWind</P>
```

Take a look at the [`design`](/tree/master/packages/app/design) folder to see how components are created with ease.

> If you're reading the NativeWind docs, you might find that you can use `className` directly without using `styled`. This will not work with Solito, since this requires the Babel plugin, and we don't want to use Babel on Next.js to stay future-proof.

## üì¶ Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `moti` for animations
- `nativewind` for theming/design (you can bring your own, too)
- Expo SDK 46
- Next.js 12
- React Navigation 6

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.
    - `design` your app's design system. organize this as you please.
      - `typography` (components for all the different text styles)
      - `layout` (components for layouts)

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev: `yarn native`
  - Runs `expo start`

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
